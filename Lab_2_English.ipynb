    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Exciting news! The **Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility** was highly impressed with the solutions developed in our initial assignment, Lab 1. They are particularly interested in implementing these algorithms in autonomous vehicle route planning, with A* as THE most effective method for identifying the optimal path efficiently. To further advance this project, the Ministry aims to strategically establish service stations across urban areas to support their autonomous vehicle fleet. These stations will act as fleet hubs and provide essential vehicle services.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, they have requested **our technical expertise to determine the optimal distribution of these stations** across city maps. However, not every intersection is eligible as a station location, the Ministry has pre-selected candidate intersections based on specific criteria established by their technical and administrative teams. Their primary focus is on sustainability and equitable access, aiming to ensure that all citizens are reasonably close to a service station. Among these selected points, only a specific number will ultimately be chosen. To aid in our task of determining which ones, they have provided data on the population coverage for each candidate intersection, allowing us to consider both accessibility and coverage in our distribution strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is then to ensure efficient access for the maximum possible population coverage while maintaining an even distribution across the city, a vital consideration for a fully autonomous transport system. As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become integral to urban transportation, ensuring reliable and readily accessible infrastructure support becomes essential. Service stations, which include power charging, maintenance, and other support services, must be strategically placed to maximize population coverage while avoiding over-servicing or neglecting certain areas. This reflects real-world urban planning and resource distribution challenges, especially relevant to AV systems where consistency and access to services are critical for safe and sustainable city-wide deployment.\n"

    "### 1.1 Objectives of the Lab Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will apply metaheuristic search techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first objective is to understand the task and formulate it from the perspective of metaheuristic searches (lessons 6, 7, and 8). This will involve the implementation of at least these two algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random Search** as a simple baseline, which will generate multiple solutions, evaluate them, and return the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Genetic Algorithm**, which should accept various parameter configurations, allowing easy tuning of arguments like population size, selection method, and operator types. (Lesson 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "These two apply for students in the continuous evaluation modality. Those students submitting for **non-continuous evaluation**, in addition to the previous two algorithms, must also include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Required: **Hill Climbing**, the local search algorithm covered in Lesson 7.\n",
    "* Optional but included in the grading: **Iterated Local Search** (ILS), also discussed in Lesson 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will analyze and compare the performance of these algorithms by running them on problem instances of varying complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this hands-on practice deepens your understanding of metaheuristic techniques and encourages you to consider their applications in real-world combinatorial optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good luck!**"

During the evaluation of a possible configuration, these initial and final points will change multiple times. This may require some adjustments to your Lab 1 code for executing A*. These changes should be clearly indicated (your code should match Lab 1 except for these changes) and discussed in the lab report.\n"

    "We need to choose $s$ stations from a number of $c$ candidate or eligible intersections, with $s<c$. Therefore, our **objective** is to decide at which of these $c$ candidate intersections we should locate the $s$ vehicle stations, so as to minimize the average travel time that each inhabitant takes from his home to the nearest station. If we denote by $S$ the vector of size $s$ containing the intersections in which the vehicle stations are located and by $C$ the vector of candidate intersections containing the pair (id, pop) for each candidate intersections, then formally, we want to solve the following optimization problem:\n",
